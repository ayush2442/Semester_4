Experiment 3:Test driven Development using Selenium
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. In the context of Selenium, which is a popular tool for automating web browsers, TDD can be implemented by following these steps:

1. Setup Your Testing Environment
Ensure you have a programming language installed (like Java, Python, etc.), a testing framework (like JUnit, TestNG for Java; unittest, pytest for Python), and the Selenium WebDriver library.

2. Define Test Cases
Identify the functionalities or scenarios you want to test on your web application.

3. Write the Test Case
Write a failing test case before writing the actual code. For example (using Python with pytest):

pythonCopy code
# test_sample.py

from selenium import webdriver

def test_title():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or Firefox(), etc.
    driver.get('https://www.example.com')
    assert driver.title == 'Example Domain'
    driver.quit()
4. Run the Test
Execute the test you just wrote. Since there's no implementation yet, it will fail.

5. Write Implementation Code
Write the actual code that fulfills the requirements specified in the failing test case.

pythonCopy code
# implementation

from selenium import webdriver

def get_title():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get('https://www.example.com')
    title = driver.title
    driver.quit()
    return title
6. Refactor
Refactor your code if necessary to improve its structure and maintainability while ensuring that the test continues to pass.

7. Repeat
Repeat this cycle for each new functionality or scenario.

Important Considerations:
Isolation: Tests should be independent and shouldn't rely on each other's state.
Coverage: Aim for a good coverage of your codebase with tests that cover different scenarios.
Refactoring: As you write new code to pass tests, occasionally refactor your code to improve its design without changing its behavior.
