AIM: Explain the software development scenario using SAFE



Objectives: 

•	Brief introduction about Scaled Agile Framework,

•	Write one scenario. 



What is SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)?

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) allows you to apply lean-agile practices at the enterprise level. It provides a simple and lightweight experience for software development. It is a set of organizations and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises for scaling lean and agile practices. It is divided into three segments which are Team, Program and portfolio.

SAFe framework allows team for,

•	Implementing Lean-Agile software and systems in enterprise level

•	It’s based on Lean and Agile principles.

•	It gives detailed guidance for work at the enterprise Portfolio, Value Stream, Program, and Team.

•	It’s designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders within an organization.

Three Building Blocks of SAFe

The SAFe model takes inspiration from Agile development practices, lean product development, and system thinking. It picks the best features from the underlying concepts to build a more innovative, workable, integrated framework.



1. Agile Development

The four values and twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto have been a guide for software developers for a long time. It was initially introduced to “undo the damages that the waterfall had done.”

The breakthrough feature introduced by agile is iteration — the ability to move to and fro at any stage of the product development process.

SAFe extracts the culture and collaborative team-based efforts that Agile promotes.



2. System Thinking

System thinking views the system as an interrelated set of elements. System thinking focuses on the amalgamation of two systems — one built for the greater benefit of the customer and the second representing the organization that builds it.

SAFe extracts the mindset that the teams, resources, and business units work in tandem toward product development initiatives.



3. Lean Product Development

Lean product development combines the best of product development practices and lean thinking. The origins of Lean Product Development are Total Quality Management and the Toyota Production System.

The essence of Lean Product development:

The continuous evaluation of existing processes to eliminate waste and delays

The principles of Lean Product Development include:

•	Understand the product development process from ideation to launch

•	Respect for people that work for the product and the culture they work in

•	Maintain a cadence of the underlying steps of product development

•	Build and release an MVP for receiving faster feedback to eliminate waste and offer value

•	Follow the principles of Kaizen, a culture of continuous improvement

•	Take the front seat and follow lean-agile leadership to ensure quality and quick delivery

SAFe extracts the lean mindset to eliminate waste while focusing on quick and quality delivery by following all the principles mentioned above.

 

Foundations of Scaled Agile Framework

 

Why Use Agile Framework?

The agile framework provides us a medium to implement agile methodology through its user-friendly, easy, and effective approach. There are 3 available agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and XP and their use depends on the requirements of the system and development team. The working of these agile frameworks follows agile manifesto principles and core values. We use the agile framework as:

•	It helps in managing agile practices.

•	It helps in early delivery like Scrum defines the development in Sprint which usually last for 2 to 4 weeks.

•	It helps in making employees satisfied as every work is visualized to all members like in the Kanban to-do list and system progress is visible on a whiteboard in form of sticky notes, which are removed from left to right on their completion.

•	It also helps in communication between team members in form of face-to-face meetings, which let them know the work progress.

•	The agile frameworks are easy to use and understand, which makes working with agile uncomplicated.

These agile frameworks are useful at team level use of agile for software development but when an organization wants to implement agile at whole organizational level then Scaled Agile Framework is use.
