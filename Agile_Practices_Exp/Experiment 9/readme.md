  VERSION IN JIRA SOFTWARE

In Jira Software, versions represent points-in-time for a project. They help you organize your work by giving you milestones to aim for. You can assign issues in your project to a specific version, and organize your sprints around completing work in that version.

Step 1: Create a version in Jira Software

Navigate to your project.
In the project menu, click on Releases.
Click on Create version.
Select the Name text box and enter a name. Optionally, schedule a Start date and/or Release date, or add a Description of this version. Click Save.
Version names are typically numeric, for example, 1.0 or 2.1.1. You could also consider using an internal codename.
HOW MANY VERSIONS SHOULD I CREATE?

You can create as many as you think is necessary. For example, you might create several versions, to plan ahead. Or you might just have one or two versions for now.

Once you create a version, the Affects version and Fix version fields will become available on your issues. 

Affects version is the version in which a bug or problem was found. Although it can be useful for tracking problems, it isn't used very often in Jira.

Fix version is the version where you plan on releasing a feature or bugfix to customers. This field is used for release planning, monitoring progress and velocity, and is used widely in reporting. This is most likely the field you want.

Step 2: Add issues to version

If your project has a backlog

Navigate to the project Backlog.
Open the Versions panel on the left.
Drag an issue to the version you want to add it to.

If your project doesn't have a backlog

Open the issue you want to add to a version.
Find the Fix version/s field, and enter the version you want to add the issue to.
Step 3: Monitoring the progress of a version

Jira Software gives you many tools you can use to check the progress of a version. We'll discuss a few of them here.

Timeline

The timeline view in Jira Software brings your issues and releases into a single place where you can plan deliverables, track progress, and share updates with stakeholders. Once you’ve configured your timeline to show Releases, you will be able to see scheduled releases along the timeline and access important details about each release directly in the timeline view.


To show releases on your timeline:

Click View settings on the top right corner of your timeline
Check the box next to Releases
